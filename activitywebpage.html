For the 1 to 1 sessions we have lots of personal trainers that will advice you on diet, excerise and give you goals to reach and an end goal that you want to get to. 1 to 1 sessions can be booked/purchased from our website or you can go into the club.

<p> Group sessions are mainly used for fitness and are a more cheaper option than 1 to 1 sessions. Also in group sessions we put on more than just swimming sessions. We have aqua aerobics, weights under water and lifeguard training. Group sessions can be booked/purchased from our website or you can go into the club.
